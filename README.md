## Description

This is a recording of a live demo given to the [NodeJS OC](http://www.meetup.com/Node-JS-OC/events/186037552/) meetup group in Irvine, CA on July 16, 2014. The original recording was 3 hours (including a break, diversions, massive amounts of debugging), but the edited version here on YouTube is just over an hour.

In it, we cover a large breadth of topics ranging from how to use Node Package Manager, to using open source software to start a downstream SaaS business, to adding features and using code coverage to tools to selectively test at-risk code, to leveraging SaltStack in small or large-scale cloud management, to using Strider-CD for continuous integration and delivery to that cloud.

Other topics hit:
* Kanban workflow
* Code coverage
* Testing
 - basic chai assertions
 - sinon stubbing
 - quickening the feedback loop
* ngrok
* how to start quickly adding value to projects you inherit from others
* custom tmux
* custom vim
